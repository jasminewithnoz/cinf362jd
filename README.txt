Though I had used a template to make my responsive website, I made sure to use a bunch of different techniques for making my website appealing.

For one, this was taken and improved upon from homework 3, where there was just a simple design but with every little going on. To improve upon in, I had completely changed the color palette from the light and dark blues and teals to something more mysterious and magical (which is in the vibe of THE WIZARD'S HANDBOOK.)

I found the palette on the website Lospec and used the darker colors in the background and the lightest colors for the text. These were added in to the CSS page where I also made adjustments things such as the font choices, button over colors and more.

Aside from colors, I added some more navigation as the "Home", "About" and "Sign Up" buttons now navigate you to dedicated pages. The only one that doesn't is the "Explore Me" page which instead navigates to a "Under Construction" page (which may be needed during future expansions of the site and the app.)
